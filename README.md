# Virtual-Deck
Virtual 52 deck of cards potentially looking to add online multiplayer.

currently everything is hard coded in due to this being a left over project from software engineering.  Unfortunately I lost some code between then and now so current progress is going int remaking and relearning an earlier build.

attempts currently are to refactor the way div elements and the deck is being constructed in the main.js file along with how images are being assigned to div elements.


build in current state is basically a proof of concept with more structure planned further down the road after milestone 1.
