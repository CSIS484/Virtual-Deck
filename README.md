# Virtual-Deck
Virtual 52 deck of cards potentially looking to add online multiplayer.

currently everything is hard coded in due to this being a left over project from software engineering.  Unfortunately I lost some code between then and now so current progress is going into remaking and relearning an earlier build. Also much of this code was written by not just me but also the software engineering team from last semester. In current state most of the work done is theirs and it wouldn't feel right not acknowledging the work they did and research especially during the most hectic months of quarentine.

attempts currently are to refactor the way div elements and the deck is being constructed in the main.js file along with how images are being assigned to div elements.

once the instantiation of 52 cards is consistent and I am confident that current code is reliable, I intend to focus on shuffling algorithms and adding a library that contains a quantity of rule sets for card games that a standard deck is used with. At this point I intend to accomplish that by milestone 2.


build in current state is basically a proof of concept with more structure planned further down the road after milestone 1.
