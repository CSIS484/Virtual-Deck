# Virtual-Deck
Virtual 52 deck of cards potentially looking to add online multiplayer.

currently everything is hard coded in due to this being a left over project from software engineering.  Unfortunately I lost some code between then and now so current progress is going into remaking and relearning an earlier build. Also much of this code was written by not just me but also the software engineering team from last semester. In current state most of the work done is theirs and it wouldn't feel right not acknowledging the work they did and research especially during the most hectic months of quarentine.

attempts currently are to refactor the way div elements and the deck is being constructed in the main.js file along with how images are being assigned to div elements.

once the instantiation of 52 cards is consistent and I am confident that current code is reliable, I intend to focus on shuffling algorithms and adding a library that contains a quantity of rule sets for card games that a standard deck is used with. At this point I intend to accomplish that by milestone 2.


build in current state is basically a proof of concept with more structure planned further down the road after milestone 1.

After milestone 1 it has become rather abundantly clear at least to me that most of the code structure at least the current way I have been defining cards is not going to work. I was able to work out some issues here and there but overall I think it would be more expedient and more will actually get done if I basically completley rework my current build. Unfortunately I have not taken the steps to start on this revamp yet since it basically means starting from scratch.  I do have a plan of action to and once I get the base build down everything else should fall into place such as shuffling and maybe even dealing cards but right now it looks like I may have to scrap plans for multiplayer functionality simply because I don't think I have the time to learn everything that it would take alongside fixing my unstable code.

send me emails with questions if anything appears unclear I would be more than happy to discuss the project/ your thoughts on it
